cw-apachelogging
----------------------------

This package is required for Clockwork's Apache -> syslog logging system.

apache2ctl
  A wrapper around Apache's apache2ctl script to create the necessary
  pipes before launching Apache.  The package installs a diversion so
  subsequent installs / upgrades of Apache do not overwrite this wrapper.

errorlog2syslog
  Watches the pipes created by the apache2ctl wrapper and injects messages
  read from the pipes into syslog, with the appropriate headers set so
  syslog-ng can place the log entries in the correct per-site log files.

log2mail
  Collect log lines sent to it by syslog-ng.  Email those log lines to the
  configured address at a specified interval.
